This was scenario of the creation of a ticket by a user, how the ticket is assigned and displays the communication of a ticket between agents; subsequently resulting in a resolution. There are other scenarios that can happen while a ticket is being assessed. A ticket can either be reassigned to a different department, escalated in severeity level, or needs to be both reassigned to a more qualified agent/department to handle the issue, depending on business impacts. This tutorial is a general overview on what help desk agents can expect to deal with on a day to day basis. Depending on the size of the company help desk agent can expect to deal with 10 to 100 tickets.
